                    Passing is considered the fundamental of volleyball. Passing is the process of bumping up the service/hits of the opposing team and is usually the first contact of the ball. Passing is extremely crucial to a team's success, as it is the first step in setting up a team's offensive play.  <br>When passing, the player would want to make sure to have a good position and control over where the ball is pass to, in order to provide a good pass. Ideally, a good pass would be one that is pass to the setter and is close to the net. Without consistent passes, the team would likely have both weak defense and offense.

                <p class = vball-text>One can consider setting to be the second step of passing. There is usually a single player that is the dedicated setter for the team during the play, no matter where the current team rotation is. The setter's job is to deliver the ball to a spot in the air where it is optimal for the hitter to hit it to virtually any side of the court. The ideal spot would be one that is high, slow, and inches away from the net. The setter is often considered the hardest position to play, as every rally would require the setter to connect the pass to the hitter.</p>

                <p class = vball-text>Hitting, often known as spiking. Typically the third contact and last contact of the ball, before the ball goes into play for the opposing team. There are three things that determine a good hitter. The footwork, timing, and contact with the ball. The hitter with good footwork will set him/herself up for a good position relative to the ball. The timing of the jump will determine the highest reach point a player could get to with the ball. Lastly, good contact when hitting determines the power and direction of the ball. </p>
